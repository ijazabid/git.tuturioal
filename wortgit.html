					<h1>History</h1>
					<p>The foundation for Noor Mahal in Bahawalpur was laid in 1872, but it was completed in 1875. At the time, the construction of the captivating structure cost somewhere around RS 1.2 million.
					As the story goes, Nawab of Bahawalpur Sir Sadiq Muhammad Khan IV, also known as the ‘Shan Jahan of Bahawalpur’ for his interest in architecture, built Noor Mahal in honour of his wife. However, she refused to live there due to its proximity to the Basti Maluk Graveyard. This double-story palace later served as a guest house for noble families. Friends of the Nawab, as well as dignitaries and other prominent personalities visiting the princely state, also stayed here. Occasionally, Nawab Sir Sadiq Muhammad also used Noor Mahal to hold cabinet meetings or as a State Court.</p>

					<h1>ARCHITECTURE</h1>

The building also has five domes representing the traditional Islamic architecture in the sub-continent along with wide Corinthian-style columns and pediments.

					<h1>Present</h1>

					<h1>Royal Places</h1>
					<p>There is no shortage of places to see and things to do in Bahawalpur.
					While Noor Mahal may be the most popular and well-maintained palace in the city, it is certainly not the only one.
					Some of the famous royal palaces in Bahawalpur include derwar fort.Located in the magnificent Cholistan Desert, Derawar Fort in Bahawalpur is considered one of the most historic forts in Pakistan. The dilapidating red-bricked structure was built as a tribute to the sovereign king of Jaisalmer and Bahawalpur region Rawal Deoraj Bhatti. It was originally constructed in the 9th century. However, Nawab Sadeq Mohammad Khan I took over the fort in 1733 and rebuilt it.</p>
					<h1>Darbar Mahal</h1>
					<p>Apart from Noor Mahal, Darbar Mahal is perhaps one of the only well-preserved royal palaces in Bahawalpur telling the story of the affluence of what was once a princely state. Built in 1905, this monument is being used as an office by the Pakistan Army. It is not open to the general public.
					Meanwhile, if you have an interest in history and love exploring new places, there are a few incredible UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Pakistan that you can check out this summer apart from Noor Mahal Bahawalpur.
